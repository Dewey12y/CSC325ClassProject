# Why use Vale and markdownlint-cli?
The Markdown language is designed to be easy to read, write, and understand, but its major benefit and detriment is its flexibility. markdownlint is an analysis tool that contains rules to create standardized and consistent Markdown files. While markdownlint checks for the formatting and structure of Markdown files, Vale looks for errors in grammar and spelling. In tandem, markdownlint and Vale ensure that any developer can create Markdown files that other developers may easily understand and work off of.
